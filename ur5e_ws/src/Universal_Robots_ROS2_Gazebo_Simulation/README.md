Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation
==========================================

Example files and configurations for Gazebo Classic simulation of Universal Robots' manipulators.

## Build status
Since Gazebo classic will not be supported from ROS 2 Jazzy on, this package is built against
Humble and Iron only. The `ros2` branch contains a version that is running on ROS Rolling on
Ubuntu 22.04 at the time of writing. However, it is no longer supported.

## Using the repository
Skip any of below steps is not applicable.

### Setup ROS Workspace

1. Create a colcon workspace:
   ```
   export COLCON_WS=~/workspaces/ur_gazebo
   mkdir -p $COLCON_WS/src
   ```

   > **NOTE:** Feel free to change `~/workspaces/ur_gazebo` to whatever absolute path you want.

   > **NOTE:** Over time you will probably have multiple ROS workspaces, so it makes sense to them all in a subfolder.
     Also, it is good practice to put the ROS version in the name of the workspace, for different tests you could just add a suffix to the base name `ur_gazebo`.

1. Download the required repositories and install package dependencies:
   ```
   cd $COLCON_WS/src
   git clone https://github.com/UniversalRobots/Universal_Robots_ROS2_Gazebo_Simulation.git
   rosdep update && rosdep install --ignore-src --from-paths . -y
   ```

### Configure and Build Workspace:
To configure and build workspace execute following commands:
  ```
  cd $COLCON_WS
  colcon build --symlink-install
  ```

## Running Simulation
```
ros2 launch ur_simulation_gazebo ur_sim_control.launch.py
```

Move robot using test script from  `ur_robot_driver` package (if you've installed that one):
```
ros2 launch ur_robot_driver test_joint_trajectory_controller.launch.py
```

Example using MoveIt with simulated robot:
```
ros2 launch ur_simulation_gazebo ur_sim_moveit.launch.py
```
